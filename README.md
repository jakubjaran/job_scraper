# job_scraper

It's a scraper in Python to search for job offers in my town.

It's looking for offers on polish sites (OLX, pracuj.pl, lm).

It uses: 
- **requests_html** for scraping,
- **dateparser** for transforming diffrent date fromats to one,
- **jsons** to turn offer object into json,

Then it serves json file with offers.
  
It's providing offers data for my **posredniak** app, check it out too.
